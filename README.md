# ML Theory Roadmap

A curated and evolving map of papers, notes, and resources related to machine learning and optimization.

This project started as a personal reading record, and grew into a structured resource grouped by topic. It includes papers I've read, am reading, or plan to return to ‚Äî sometimes annotated with insights or links to notes.
