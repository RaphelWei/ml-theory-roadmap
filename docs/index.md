# Welcome

This site is a hub for papers, notes, and resources I’ve read, am reading, or intend to return to — grouped by topic, and occasionally annotated when I have something to say.

Use the sidebar to navigate topics and resource types.

## What you'll find here

- Papers organized by **topic**
- A growing list of **books**, **courses**, and **reference materials**  
- Occasional annotations or reflections on papers I've found insightful

## Why this roadmap?

As a CS Ph.D. student in ML theory, I wanted a way to:

- Organize important papers and ideas
- Connect related topics across subfields
- Document my understanding and insights
- Share with others who may benefit

This roadmap is still under construction, but if you’ve found something worth adding, or feel like helping me shape it, PRs are welcome.
